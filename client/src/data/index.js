  startDate: "7 AUG, 2022",
  endDate: "8 AUG, 2021",
  resultDate: "9 AUG, 2021",
  overview: "The Handloom Sector is one of the largest unorganized economic activities and it constitutes an integral part of the rural and semi-rural livelihood. The level of artistry and intricacy achieved in the handloom fabrics is unparalleled and certain weaves/designs are still beyond the scope of modern machines.There are 28.2 Lakh handlooms in India as per the 4th handloom Census.To preserve the rich handloom heritage of our country, innovative, cost- effective handlooms are needed in the handloom sector.",
  details: "The Handloom Grand Challenge by O/o Development Commissioner, Ministry of Textiles, in partnership with Startup India and Invest India invites innovative, cost-effective solutions for developing technologically upgraded handlooms which can provide better quality handloom products with reduced stress/drudgery for weavers during handloom weaving.",
  problemStatement:"Increase in the handloom productivity and reduction of stress in weaving on handloom through innovative & cost effective loom development",
  problemStatementDetails: "Increasing Productivity-Typically the average speech of handloom ranges from 60-72 picks per minute. Suitable changes in design and mechanism of handloom need to be explored for increasing its speed without changing its nature i.e. 3 primary motions (shredding, picking & beating) will be operated manually only, to qualify the product as handloom.Reducing Stress of weavers- Need to explore the possibility of stress / drudgery reduction of weavers in the operation of handloom particularly while weaving heavy fabric using coarse yarns by suitable changes in the design and mechanism of handlooms without changing its primary nature.",
