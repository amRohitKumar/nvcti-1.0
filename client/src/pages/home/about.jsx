            With the mission to provide students with a platform for promoting
            experimentation, innovation and creative output skills, we, at NVCTI
            are putting endeavours to inculcate convoluted thinking in an
            aesthetic approach in the minds of students and faculty members by
            polarizing thoughts into the process and thereby into a product. We
            also promote an innovation ecosystem to subsidize our students in
            their quest to explore and contribute to the world of cutting-edge
            technologies and entrepreneurship.
